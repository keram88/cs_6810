\begin{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{Memory Scheduling Mechanisms (20 points): } For the following memory access pattern, estimate when each memory access completes for two different scheduling mechanisms: \textbf{open-page policy} and \textbf{close-page policy}. You are allowed to reorder requests already waiting in the memory controller. The access pattern only specifies the row being touched. All accesses are to the \textbf{same} bank. Assume that bus latencies are zero. Assume that the bank is already pre-charged at time 0. Assume that pre-charge takes 20 ns, loading a row buffer takes 20 ns, and cache line transfer to output pins also takes 20 ns.\newline

 \hline
 X  & 10 ns & 50ns (RAS + CAS) & 50ns for data \\
    &       &                  & Next command at 70ns\\

 Y  & 90 ns & 150ns (Pre + RAS + CAS) & 170ns for data\\
    &       &                  & Next command at 190ns\\
 \hline
 X  & 100 ns & 210ns (Pre + RAS + CAS) & 230ns for data\\
    &       &                  & Next command at 250ns\\
 \hline
 Y  & 180 ns & 270ns (Pre + RAS + CAS)  & 290ns for data\\
    &       &                  & Next command at 310ns\\

\end{center}
The scheduling in the open page policy doesn't quite line up to allow us
to reorder loads, hence we have to do row cycling on the last 3 accesses.

The closed page policy always does a RAS and CAS for the load, then a precharge,
effectively the next command cannot start until 70ns after the first one was
issued. The closed page policy could be reordered, e.g., the last X 
could come before the first Y, but it wouldn't really affect the final total
time for all memory accesses to complete.
 
\item \textbf{Memory System Design (20 points): } Modern systems have processors with four memory channels. Assume that a memory channel has 64 bits for data and 24 bits for address and command.
Assume that a memory channel is connected to eight x8 memory chips. Consider a new memory system that shrinks the data bus of the memory channel to 32 bits. Assume that such a channel would be connected to four x8 memory chips. Mention \textbf{two pros} and \textbf{two cons} of the new memory system (Be very concise).\newline

Pros:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There are fewer wires connecting the DRAM to the CPU.
\item A single memory access has lower latency.
\end{enumerate}

Cons:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Lower bandwidth on the bus.
\item The number of DRAM commands will be doubled.
\end{enumerate}
 
\item \textbf {Virtually Indexed Physically Tagged Cache (20 points): }  Assume that the OS uses a minimum page size of 4 KB. Assume that your L1 cache must be 8-way set-associative. If you're trying to correctly implement a virtually indexed physically tagged cache (with no additional support from the OS), what is the largest L1 cache that you can design? \newline

  We have 4KB = $2^{12}$B pages, so our cache index and offset are 12
  bits from the VA. We have 8 entries per set giving the formula
  $cache_{size}= 8\cdot2^{index}\cdot2^{offset}$ since
  $index + offset = 12$, we have a cache of size
  $2^{15}$B=32KB, regardless of the number of sets or cache line width.

\item \textbf {DRAM Control (10 points): } Express the latency of a memory load as a function of tRAS, tRP, tRCD, tCL in the following situations:

 \begin{enumerate}
 \item  The correct row is already placed in the row buffer

   If there is a row hit, we need only do a CAS. Here we have {\it
     t}CL which is the time for the row buffer to be readable
   (volatages are stable enough to know the content) after a CAS. The
   time in this situation is {\it t}CL. (I referenced 
   \begin{verbatim} https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory\end{verbatim}
   for this).

 \item  Another row is already placed in the row buffer.

In the case of a full row and a miss, we need to do a precharge, activate and
CAS. The commands we issue are Row Precharge (RP), RAS and CAS, this takes time
{\it t}RP + {\it t}RCD + {\it t}CL.
 \end{enumerate}

\item \textbf {DRAM Control Tasks â€“ Request Scheduling (20 points): }  Find the total number of commands sent by an in-order command scheduler for the given sequence of memory addresses for reads, using the following address mapping scheme:

\hspace{20pt} Address = row(12):bank(3):rank(1):channel(0):column(16)\newline
\hspace{20pt} Assume that all banks are initially precharged.

\center Addresses: \newline
00040108\newline
01040101\newline
00161804\newline
01040104\newline
\begin{table}[H]
\small
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Address & row(13) & bank(3) & column(16) & Commands & Reason\\
\hline
0x00040108 & 0000000000000 & 100 & 0000000100001000 & Activate, Read & Row buffer empty\\
\hline
0x01040101 & 0000000100000 & 100 & 0000000100000001 & Precharge, Activate, Read & Row miss\\
\hline
0x00161804 & 0000000000010 & 110 & 0001100000000100 & Activate, Read & Row buffer empty\\
\hline
0x01040104 & 0000000100000 & 100 & 0000000100000100 & Read & Row hit\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Eight commands are needed for this sequence of memory accesses.
